# **Zero Shot Text Classification**

This project will create a Python-based zero-shot text classification RESTful web service using FastAPI and Poetry. The web service will leverage the BERT-based pre-trained models available in the Hugging Face's transformers library.

Zero-shot text classification is a type of machine learning approach that allows a model to recognize and classify new classes based on zero-labeled examples of these classes. This is done by using a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset of text and labels.
